This is an example folder.
==========================

The `status_message.wasm` here comes from [near-examples/rust-status-message][1]. You can see how this file is loaded in a test in `__tests__/main.ava.ts`.

You probably have your own compiled Wasm files somewhere for your own contracts. Now that you have a working example of how to load such files, feel free to change the test to use your own files and get rid of this folder.
